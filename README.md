# GettingCleaningDataProject

The purpose of this project is to collect and clean a data set in order to make it ready for later analysis.

## Files provided in the repository
In this repository you can find the following files:
* CodeBook.md: containing the description of the tidy data-set (variables, levels of factors)
* run_analysis.R: script used to clean the data set and to obtain "dataset-final.txt"
* dataset-final.txt: the "tidy-data-set".

Here below, after a short description of the original data set, I summarize the procedure implemented in order to obtain a tidy data set ("dataset-final.txt").

## Description of the original data set

*Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
*Version 1.0
*==================================================================
*Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
*Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
*DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
*Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
*activityrecognition@smartlab.ws
*www.smartlab.ws


The initial dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are also available for the train and test data. 

*'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
*'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
*'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
*'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 


## Cleaning procedure

The following step have been performed in order to obtain the tidy data set:
* Download of the original data.set, unzip and exploaration of the files contained in the folder. We build the training file by merging the data contained in the folder "./train" (no subfloder considered), and similary for the training set in the folder "./train". 
The names of the columns have been extracted 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
